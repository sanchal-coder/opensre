    and each Terraform apply explicitly chooses which tag to deploy.

    Default 'bootstrap' is a placeholder so `terraform apply` succeeds
    before the bench framework Dockerfile lands. Once images are being
    pushed, override per apply: `terraform apply -var=image_tag=<tag>`,
    or pin a value in terraform.tfvars / the pre-registration YAML.
