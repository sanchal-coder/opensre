# Interactive shell package

These instructions apply to `interactive_shell/` and all of its
subdirectories. The repo-root `AGENTS.md` still applies.

## Purpose

`interactive_shell/` owns the interactive OpenSRE terminal: the REPL
loop, slash-command surface, local alert ingestion, LLM-backed help/chat,
action planning, shell execution, session state, history, and Rich /
prompt-toolkit UI.

Design for a terminal user who may be in the middle of an incident: behavior
should be predictable, interruptible, explainable, and safe by default.

## Package map and ownership

| Area | Owns | Keep out |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `controller.py` | top-level REPL wiring | feature-specific business logic or compatibility-only forwarding |
| `entrypoint.py` | process/bootstrap boundary for starting the REPL | per-turn dispatch/runtime logic |
| `turn_accounting.py` | turn-result data model (`ToolCallingTurnResult`, `ShellTurnResult`) and `ShellTurnAccounting` (analytics, telemetry, recorder flush, turn persistence, intent stamp) | turn-flow control (owned by `harness/agent.py`) or tool-calling turn execution (owned by `harness/tool_calling.py`) |
| `command_registry/` | slash-command definitions, argument validation, command dispatch | long-running implementation details better placed in services/runtime modules |
| `session/` | `ReplSession`, runtime context assembly, and session persistence (storage backends + cross-session repo) | UI rendering, prompt text, and runtime task scheduling |
| `runtime/` | background tasks, lifecycle/`ReplState`, controller/entrypoint support modules (lazily re-exports the `session/` surface for back-compat) | UI rendering, prompt text, and session persistence |
| `orchestration/` | action planning, execution policy, subprocess runner, deterministic command detection, and interaction models | raw UI formatting |
| `tools/shell/` | shell command parsing, shell execution policy, subprocess execution, and the `run_shell_command`/`run_cd`/`run_pwd` runner (next to the `shell_run` tool in `tools/shell_tool.py`) | slash-command execution |
| `harness/response.py` | final response generation (`generate_response`), action-plan parsing, and capability validation | direct mutation of runtime state outside the subprocess runner |
| `references/` | CLI/docs/source/AGENTS reference loading and caching | generated model prose |
| `config/` | interactive-shell config loading and tool catalog metadata | global app config unrelated to the REPL |
| `harness/llm_context/` | LLM prompt + grounding context: action/assistant system prompts, the shared recent-conversation helper (`conversation_memory.py`), the session-scoped grounding caches (`grounding/` CLI/docs/AGENTS.md, aggregated by `GroundingContext`), and prompt-toolkit input-history persistence + secret redaction (`prompt_history/`) | session persistence (owned by `session/`) |
| `ui/` | Rich/prompt-toolkit rendering, theme, menus, streaming output, and domain views such as `incoming_alerts.py` (receiver/queue/listener lifecycle lives in `core.domain.alerts.inbox`) | business logic or network calls |

When a change crosses these boundaries, prefer extracting a small helper in the
owning area rather than adding more logic to the caller.

## Cross-cutting rules

- Treat every external input as untrusted: user prompt text, slash-command args,
  alert payloads, files read into prompts, history, subprocess output, model
  output, and integration metadata.
- Keep the interactive path responsive. Long-running work must be cancellable,
  timeout-bounded, moved off the input path, or surfaced with clear progress.
- Preserve import-time lightness. Do not start threads, call LLMs, read large
  files, or contact networks at module import time.
- Prefer explicit data models and typed helpers over loosely shaped dictionaries
  when data crosses submodule boundaries.
- Keep user-visible strings intentional. Slash-command names, flags, output
  labels, prompts, response bodies, and error wording are user-facing API.
- Avoid new module-level mutable globals. If global coordination is unavoidable,
  provide deterministic reset/cleanup hooks and test isolation.
- Do not keep compatibility-only forwarding modules after moving code. Migrate
  callers/tests to the canonical owner and remove the old import path in the
  same change.

## Slash commands

- Add commands as `SlashCommand` entries in the relevant `command_registry/*`
  module. Keep handlers small: parse args, call focused helpers, render result.
- **REPL + CLI parity (required):** Every command in `SLASH_COMMANDS` must have a
  matching `_MCP_BY_COMMAND` entry in
  `command_registry/slash_catalog.py`. That catalog feeds the LLM planner (`slash_invoke`),
  planner tool specs, and compact help text. Without it, CI fails
  (`test_slash_catalog_covers_all_registered_commands`).
  - **New REPL-only slash command:** add `SlashCommand` in the owning
    `command_registry/*` module **and** `_mcp(...)` in `slash_catalog.py` (keep
    keys sorted alphabetically in `_MCP_BY_COMMAND`).
  - **New CLI with REPL parity:** add the Click command under `cli/commands/`,
    register a `SlashCommand` in `command_registry/cli_parity.py` (subprocess to
    `opensre …`), **and** add `_MCP_BY_COMMAND` in `slash_catalog.py` with
    `llm_description`, `use_cases`, and `anti_examples` aligned to the command’s
    `usage` tuple.
  - **Verify before push:**
    `uv run python -m pytest tests/interactive_shell/command_registry/test_slash_catalog.py -q`
- Use `validate_args` for cheap pre-policy validation so bad arguments do not
  trigger confirmations or side effects.
- Send command execution through the central dispatch and execution-policy
  helpers. Do not bypass `execution_policy.py` for new commands.
- **Alpha allow-all execution policy (current behavior):** the REPL runs with
  **no command guardrails**. `execution_policy.py` resolves every action to
  `allow` with **no confirmation prompt** — all slash/`opensre` commands,
  investigations, synthetic tests, code-agent launches, LLM runtime switches, and
  **all** shell commands run immediately, in any context (TTY or not, trust mode
  or not). There is **no shell-command safety policy**: the
  read-only/mutating/restricted classification and the `deny` floor were removed
  (`shell_policy.py` deleted; parsing/policy/execution live under
  `tools/shell/`). Mutating commands (`rm`/`mv`/`docker`), `restricted` commands
  (`sudo`, `systemctl`, `kill`, `dd`, …), shell operators (`| && ; > <`), and
  command substitution all run; the `!` prefix is honored but optional. The only
  shell input still rejected is genuinely empty input (a bare `!` or whitespace).
  Do **not** re-add a shell allowlist or deny floor while in alpha — see
  `docs/interactive-shell-action-policy.md`. The former `ExecutionTier`
  classification was removed because it gated nothing under default-allow; if an
  opt-in stricter policy is reintroduced after alpha, gate it in
  `execution_policy.py` (the `ask` verdict, confirmation UX, and `trust_mode` are
  retained as the hook), not via a planner-stage denial.
- Non-TTY behavior under default-allow: actions no longer fail closed on
  non-interactive stdin (there is nothing to confirm). The fail-closed path only
  applies if a verdict is explicitly `ask`, which the default policy does not
  emit.
- **CPR / exclusive-stdin registration (required for table-outputting commands):**
  Under `patch_stdout(raw=True)`, the REPL runs dispatch concurrently with the
  next `prompt_async()`. When a command emits Rich table output, prompt_toolkit
  redraws the prompt mid-flight, sending an `ESC[6n` DSR query; the terminal's
  CPR response (`ESC[<row>;<col>R`) arrives as literal keystrokes in the incoming
  prompt buffer, causing garbage like `^[[60;1R` to appear.
  **Any command that calls `print_repl_table` (directly or via `render_table` /
  `render_integrations_table` / `render_models_table` / etc.) must be added to
  `_EXCLUSIVE_STDIN_MENU_COMMANDS` in `runtime/utils/input_policy.py`.** That makes the main
  loop call `await state.queue.join()`, blocking the next prompt until dispatch
  completes and both drain cycles clean up stale CPR bytes before the next
  `prompt_async()` starts.
  - **How to check:** after adding a command, run it in the REPL and type a few
    characters in the next prompt. If no `^[[…R` garbage appears, the registration
    is correct.
  - **Agent-selected interactive commands:** `_EXCLUSIVE_STDIN_MENU_COMMANDS`
    only reserves stdin for literal `/slash` command text that
    `_literal_slash_command_text` recognizes. When free text like
    "remove github" is resolved by the action agent into an inline-picker
    command (`/integrations remove`, `/integrations setup`, `/mcp connect`,
    `/mcp disconnect`, or a bare `/integrations` / `/mcp` menu), the loop has not
    reserved stdin, so `slash_tool.py` must NOT run the picker inline. It defers
    via `session.queue_auto_command(...)`, which re-submits the command as
    literal command text so the loop can reserve exclusive stdin before the
    agent path runs it. New raw-stdin picker/wizard commands the action agent can emit
    must be added to
    `_INTERACTIVE_PICKER_MENUS` / `_INTERACTIVE_PICKER_SUBCOMMANDS` in
    `interactive_shell/tools/slash_tool.py`.

## Action Selection And Execution

- **Hard boundary:** do not add regex/keyword/fuzzy intent routing, literal
  slash-command action shortcuts, or any deterministic action path that bypasses
  the action agent. Engineers have been fired before for implementing this
  exact shortcut. This includes "safe" looking mappings like "show integrations"
  -> `/integrations` or direct `/status` dispatch inside the agent turn.
- **No planning-stage fail-closed safeguard (v0.1 decision).** The second-phase
  action agent never denies a turn. Because every terminal action is read-only,
  an unmatched/ambiguous/chatty clause is not a safety risk — the agent executes
  the clauses it can map and lets the rest fall through to the conversational
  assistant. We removed the `denied` decision path, the `mark_unhandled` planner
  tool, the `UNHANDLED:` convention, and the "I couldn't safely decide actions"
  message because they caused frequent false denials (e.g. a conversational
  question that embedded a quoted, list-style directive) with no safety upside.
  Details and rationale live in `core/agent_harness/AGENTS.md`. If
  mutating actions are ever introduced, gate them with the
  execution-stage confirmation policy (`tools/shared/execution_policy.py`), not a
  planner-stage denial.
- Keep deterministic command detection in `orchestration/` for terminal UI
  policy only; use the action agent for slash/tool action selection.
- Send uncertainty to a safe surface: help/chat or a clarification, not direct
  mutation or shell execution.
- LLM-generated text must never execute directly. Convert proposed actions into
  explicit planned actions, show them to the user when appropriate, then execute
  through `orchestration/` and policy gates.
- Keep action summaries human-readable and specific enough for confirmation UX
  and audit logs.
- When adding a new action type, test allowed, denied, and confirmation-required
  paths.

## LLM prompts, grounding, and references

- Keep prompts bounded. Enforce size caps for docs, source chunks, histories,
  observations, alert text, and command output included in model context.
- Ground procedural/help answers in maintained references (`docs/`, CLI help,
  AGENTS files, source snippets). If references do not support an answer, say so
  rather than inventing steps.
- Do not include secrets in prompts. Redact or omit tokens, auth headers, env
  values, local credentials, and raw integration config.
- Keep prompt rules reusable in `harness/llm_context/` so chat/help/action surfaces use
  consistent terminology and formatting.
- Reference caches should be deterministic, invalidatable when source files
  change, and cheap to rebuild in tests.

## Terminal UI and rendering

- Escape user-controlled content before passing it to Rich markup
  (`rich.markup.escape`): alerts, command output, file paths, integration names,
  model/provider labels, errors, docs snippets, and model text that is not
  already intentionally rendered as Markdown.
- Use semantic tokens from `ui/theme.py`. Do not introduce raw hex colors, Rich
  named colors, or raw ANSI escapes outside `ui/theme.py` unless a narrow
  prompt-toolkit compatibility path requires it.
- Keep rendering helpers as pure as practical: accept data, return/render Rich
  objects, avoid reading config or mutating session state from UI modules.
- Any raw terminal-mode code must check TTY support and restore terminal state
  in `finally`.
- Be careful mixing `prompt_toolkit.patch_stdout`, Rich live rendering, and
  background output. Prefer append-only, paragraph-buffered, or throttled
  rendering paths that do not corrupt the editable prompt.
- UI changes should handle narrow terminals, non-ASCII fallback where relevant,
  long text, empty states, and non-TTY automation.

## Shell, subprocesses, and local system effects

- Shell execution changes belong under `shell/` and must preserve parsing,
  quoting, timeout, redaction, and policy behavior.
- Treat subprocess output as untrusted display text; escape it before Rich
  markup and cap what is retained or sent to prompts.
- Use explicit timeouts and clear cancellation behavior for subprocesses. Avoid
  waits that can hang the REPL indefinitely.
- Keep allow/deny decisions explainable. If a command is blocked, return a
  user-facing reason and a safe alternative when possible.

## State, history, config, and background work

- Prefer explicit `ReplSession` fields for session state. Keep ownership clear:
  runtime owns lifecycle, history owns persistence, config owns shell-specific
  settings.
- Background threads/tasks/listeners must have deterministic shutdown. Tests
  should stop handles and workers in fixtures or `finally` blocks.
- Protect shared queues and mutable session data with locks or single-owner
  discipline. Avoid check-then-act races around queues, cancellation flags,
  current tasks, and listener handles.
- History should avoid storing secrets or excessive payloads. Apply truncation
  and privacy policy consistently.
- Config loading should degrade gracefully with actionable errors; do not make
  the REPL unusable because an optional config or catalog source is missing.

## External input and local listener safety

- Network-ish local surfaces such as `core.domain.alerts.inbox` (started by the
  REPL entrypoint) must validate cheap request metadata before blocking reads or
  expensive parsing.
- Never perform unbounded request-body reads. For alert POSTs specifically,
  validate `Content-Length` first, and only then read the bounded body:
  - non-numeric `Content-Length` values make `int(...)` raise `ValueError`;
    catch this and return `400`.
  - negative lengths must return `400`; `rfile.read(-1)` reads until EOF rather
    than zero bytes, which can stall the single-threaded handler.
  - oversized positive lengths must return `413` without attempting to read the
    advertised body.
- Preserve clean unauthorized responses for real POST bodies by draining only a
  bounded body before returning `401`; this avoids close-with-unread-data resets
  on some platforms without allowing oversized pre-auth reads.
- Keep request-size and malformed-header checks effective for both authenticated
  and unauthenticated callers.
- Keep non-loopback listener binding protected by a token. Use constant-time
  token comparison and never log bearer tokens, raw auth headers, or full alert
  payloads.

## Testing expectations

- Put tests under `tests/interactive_shell/`, mirroring the package area
  when useful (`orchestration/`, `ui/`, etc.). Never add tests under
  `app/`.
- For focused changes, run the closest tests, for example:
  - `uv run python -m pytest tests/core/domain/alerts/test_inbox.py`
  - `uv run python -m pytest tests/interactive_shell/<area>/`
  - `uv run python -m pytest tests/interactive_shell/`
- Add regression tests for incident-prone edges: platform socket behavior,
  malformed input, non-TTY execution, cancellation, policy denial, prompt-size
  caps, Rich escaping, and background cleanup.
- Prefer deterministic tests over sleep-heavy tests. Use fake classifiers,
  fake sessions, fake consoles, monkeypatched subprocesses, and small fixtures.
- For UI work, test pure formatting/rendering helpers where possible and keep
  full REPL-loop tests minimal.
- For action-planning or execution-policy changes, test both safe fallback behavior and
  the intended positive path.

## Change checklist

Before considering an interactive-shell change complete, check:

1. Is the logic in the right submodule, with import-time side effects avoided?
2. Is user-facing behavior preserved or intentionally documented?
3. Are unsafe actions sent through execution policy with the correct tier?
4. Are external inputs bounded, escaped, redacted, and timeout-protected?
5. Do background resources shut down deterministically?
6. Are focused tests added or updated under `tests/interactive_shell/`?
7. If `SLASH_COMMANDS` changed, does `slash_catalog.py` include every command
   (REPL and `cli_parity`)? Run `test_slash_catalog.py`.
