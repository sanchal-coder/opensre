"""Live tool-gathering pass for the interactive-shell assistant.

The REPL's conversational assistant (:func:`app.cli.interactive_shell.chat.cli_agent.answer_cli_agent`)
is grounded text generation — it cannot reach integrations on its own. This
module gives a free-form turn access to the **same registered tools the
investigation pipeline uses**: it runs a bounded think → call-tools → observe
loop (:func:`app.agent.tool_loop.run_tool_calling_loop`) over the available
``"investigation"`` surface tools, then hands the collected tool outputs back to
``answer_cli_agent`` as an observation block so it can compose a grounded answer.

Design notes:

* Tools are read-only data fetches, so calls run autonomously (no per-call
  confirmation) exactly like the investigation agent — see the routing decision
  recorded for this feature.
* When no integrations are configured (no tools available), gathering is a fast
  no-op and the normal text-only assistant path runs unchanged.
* Integration resolution is cached on the session so repeated turns don't
  re-resolve or re-render progress.
