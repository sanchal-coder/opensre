# agent-planned action back into the OpenSRE interactive shell. Any command that
# is registered in the slash-command registry is already an OpenSRE command and
# must stay eligible here.
#
# Keep this registry-backed instead of listing subcommands like
# `/integrations setup` or `/integrations remove`: duplicating subcommand lists
# here drifts from the actual dispatcher and causes valid OpenSRE commands to be
# rejected before the normal policy/confirmation flow can evaluate them. The
# dispatcher remains the source of truth for argument validation, execution tier,
# confirmation, exclusive-stdin handling, and the command's side effects.

# The only thing this gate should reject is non-OpenSRE input: empty strings,
# shell snippets, arbitrary text, or unknown slash commands. Do not reintroduce
