"""Deterministic intent helpers used by the fallback action planner.

LLM-first planning is the primary path for non-slash requests. These helpers are
kept for deterministic fallback behavior and regression tests.

Public API is stable: all names exported below are importable directly from
``intent_parser`` and will remain so regardless of internal submodule changes.
